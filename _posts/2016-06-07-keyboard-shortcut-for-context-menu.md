This is going to probably be the shortest article I wrote, or will write!

Have you ever wanted to open the right click menu on something without lifting your hands from the keyboard? I did a lot of times, especially when navigating through videos wanting to **open** them **with** the non-default application (which can be done with the **Open with** option in the right click context menu).

Well, you can do it with the following keyboard shortcut:

```bash
Shift + F10
```

**Warning:** It does not work in **all** the applications, but it does in the file manager I use which is enough for me :)

Alternatively, you can set keyboard shortcuts to trigger mouse events including right click, but this is out of this article's scope.
