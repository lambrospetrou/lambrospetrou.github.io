Many users are dual booting Windows and Ubuntu for numerous reasons today. Well a problem that may arise is that if you have Dropbox, you should have 2 folders of your Dropbox files, 1 for Windows and 1 for Ubuntu.

Following the guide below you can consolidate them into one and reclaim your wasted space back.

**NOTE**: I am assuming that the Windows partition is mounted at startup when you boot into Ubuntu.

## Guidelines

1. Set up your Dropbox folder inside **Windows** first and verify that it is syncing your files without problems.

2. Boot into Ubuntu and stop Dropbox from syncing.

    ```bash
    pkill dropbox
    ```

3. Delete your Dropbox folder from Ubuntu (the command below assumes it's located in your home directory).

    ```bash
    rm -rf /home/_username_/Dropbox/
    ```

4. Create a symlink to your Windows Dropbox folder (this will create a symbolic link  in your home directory that links to your Dropbox folder in Windows).

    ```bash
    ln -s /media/WindowsOS/User/_username_/Dropbox /home/_username_/Dropbox
    ```

    ```/media/WindowsOS/User/_username_/Dropbox```
    the path to the Dropbox folder in your Windows partition mounted in Ubuntu  

    ```/home/_username_/Dropbox```
    the default folder for Dropbox to synchronize

5. Reboot and youâ€™ re finished. Now you maintain only one copy of your Dropbox folder which needs to be synced only once, no matter which OS is booted at any time.

That's it, I hope you won't find any problems. If you do though, contact me :)
