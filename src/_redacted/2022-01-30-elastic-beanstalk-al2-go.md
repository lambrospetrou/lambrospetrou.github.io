title: AWS Elastic Beanstalk Go platform (AL2) â€” Deep Dive
description: "A deep dive into the Elastic Beanstalk Go platform (Amazon Linux 2), including single and multiple processes, and logging."
---

Even though my default and preferred way of deploying applications is [#serverless platforms](/articles/serverless-platforms-2022/), sometimes I need an actual long-running host. For example, some of the applications I run (e.g. [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)) are written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as their database so in that case serverless does not work.

In this article I will explore the [Elastic Beanstalk Go platform based on Amazon Linux 2 (AL2)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-environment.html) for deploying a simple application. As a comparison, a couple of years ago I [wrote about the older Go platform](/articles/multiple-services-elastic-beanstalk/) based on Amazon Linux 1.

Even though I focus on the Go platform, **almost everything applies to all the new Amazon Linux 2 based platforms (e.g. [Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/java-se-platform.html))**. You can also use the Go platform to deploy any application that is compiled to a binary that can run on Amazon Linux 2 (e.g. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)).

## Why use Elastic Beanstalk?

Looking for a platform to deploy a simple Dockerfile or a self-contained application (e.g. Go, Rust, Node.js). I need:
1. persistent disk volume
2. one server instance only
3. deployments in-place on same instance (unless I can have same volume attached on more than 1 instance)
4. managed platform (OS) updates
5. <5$/month

## Overview

The Amazon Linux 2 based platforms were added back in [2020](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-a-new-generation-of-aws-elastic-beanstalk-platforms/), and with that upgrade all the platforms now follow (almost) the same conventions and setup ([see supported Linux platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux.html#platforms-linux.versions)), which is a nice improvement over the previous platforms based on Amazon Linux 1 where each language had its own idiosyncracies.

The AWS documentation contains most of the things we need to know about the platforms but unfortunately as usual it's like they intentionally try to make it hard on their users, and they spread the information across multiple pages. I will try to cover the main features of the platform and add references at the end of the article to the main documentation pages we need. 

All AL2 platforms offer the following features ([see documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html)):
- **Buildfile**: one-off commands to run from inside the uploaded bundle, e.g. building the source code to create the binary to run.
- **Procfile**: long-running monitored commands to run, e.g. the web server.
- **Platform hooks**: one-off commands to run during the deployment lifecycle hooks (e.g. predeploy, postdeploy). New to AL2 based platforms.
- **Reverse proxy configuration**: `nginx` is used as the reverse proxy for most platforms and there is a way to override its configuration. Some platforms also provide Apache HTTPD as proxy (e.g. Tomcat, Node.js, PHP, and Python).
- **Configuration files (.ebextensions)**: configuration to extend the Beanstalk environment. For example, add new CloudFormation resources (e.g. DynamoDB tables, EBS volumes), customise existing CloudFormation resources (e.g. the EC2 instance), override files on the filesystem, and many more.

Let's go into details for each one of these for the [Go platform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-environment.html) specifically.

### Buildfile

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-buildfile.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html

The `Buildfile` file should be placed at the root of the uploaded bundle `.zip` file and contains one-off commands that we want to run as part of the **build** phase of the deployment. The current working directory of each running command is the root of the uploaded bundle. If you do not run any [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/) system to build your source code before-hand, and your uploaded bundle contains your source code then this is where you would put your application compile command.

For example, the following `Buildfile` would compile the Go application and create a binary file named `app` into the `bin/` directory:
```
cmd1: go build -o bin/app
```

The `cmd1:` part is nothing but just a name and does not have any meaning other than differentiating the commands to run. The following is also valid:
```
build: go build -o bin/app
check: ./validate-app-binary.sh
```

**Personal opinion:** I never use the `Buildfile` to build my application and I always have a CI system to build the source code (or even build it locally). This means that my uploaded bundle `.zip` file only contains the compiled artifacts, e.g. the `bin/app` binary from the above example. This makes deployments a bit faster as well since the build phase will not happen during the Beanstalk lifecycle and I don't worry about my build process being constrained by the machine running the actual application. For example, if you have a lot of dependencies or your tests need a lot of resources then doing it before triggering a Beanstalk deployment will allow you to use smaller lightweight instances for the actual application in production (e.g. `T3.nano`, `T4G.nano`).

### Procfile

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-procfile.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html

The Go platform also supports conventions to [automatically build and run your application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-environment.html), but I personally avoid them since they are less flexible than using `Procfile` and there is zero benefit in using them.

The `Procfile` file should be placed at the root of the uploaded bundle `.zip` file and contains the long-running commands that we want to run as part of the application. Each process started by these commands will be monitored by the environment and automatically restarted when they crash. This is the place where we specify the main command(s) to start the server/application we want to run.

For example, the following starts the `bin/app` and `bin/bgapp` with the right flags:
```
web: ./bin/app -name webapp
bgapp: ./bin/bgapp -name bgapp -port 5001
```

By default, Elastic Beanstalk listens to requests on HTTP port `80` and forwards them to port `5000` inside the host which is the port the application should listen on. Elastic Beanstalk sets the `PORT=5000` environment variable when running the process named `web` in the `Procfile`, therefore the application will need to read that env variable when setting up its HTTP listener. The application could also ignore the `PORT` env variable and hardcode port `5000` but it makes it harder to start your application on different ports (e.g. locally), so do the nice thing and read the env variable on startup ([see example application code below](#example-application)).

**NOTE:** The default port can be changed from `5000` to something else by using `.ebextensions` and setting the `aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment.PORT` property. Read more about this in the [reverse proxy configuration docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html#platforms-linux-extend.proxy) (make sure to expand the "Reverse proxy configuration" section).

**NOTE:** In the previous version of the platform (AL1) all processes in the `Procfile` were getting the `PORT` set to a value starting from `5000` and then growing in increments of `+100`. This **does not apply anymore in AL2 platforms** and **only** the explicitly named `web` process has the `PORT` env set, which is why I explicitly set the port for `bgapp` in the above example.

There are some nuances around logging and how the logs are streamed to CloudWatch Logs when `Procfile` contains more than the `web` process but we will [explore those later](#logging).

### Platform hooks

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html

Platform hooks are a new addition to the AL2 based platforms. The only way to extend and customise Elastic Beanstalk before was using the `.ebextensions` configuration files but that was/is complicated and very error-prone. Platforms hooks cover 90% of all use-cases (personal guesstimate), and they make our lives much easier.

The [Platform hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html#platforms-linux-extend.hooks) (expand section) are basically script files placed inside the `.platform/hooks` directory, under one of the following sub-directories: `prebuild`, `predeploy`, `postdeploy`.

The scripts inside each of those directories are run in order of their filename. For example, let's examine the following directory structure:
```sh
$ ls .platform/hooks/**
.platform/hooks/postdeploy:
01-validate-http.sh  02-update-route53.sh

.platform/hooks/predeploy:
01-setup-ebs.sh
```

With the above scripts the script `01-setup-ebs.sh` will be executed before the new version of the app is flipped to be active, and after the switch the `01-validate-http.sh` and `02-update-route53.sh` will run in this specific order due to the naming.

#### Config hooks

Apart from the `.platform/hooks` directory, there is also a `.platform/confighooks` directory supported. Initially, the difference between the two is confusing. Even though the available hooks and execution rules are the same, the type of changes in a deployment will decide which hooks to trigger. 

> A configuration deployment occurs when you make configuration changes that only update environment instances without recreating them.

According to the docs the following changes trigger `.platform/confighooks` only:
- Environment properties and platform-specific settings
- Static files
- AWS X-Ray daemon
- Log storage and streaming
- Application port

**NOTE:** In order to make sure a script runs regardless of the type of changes it has to be placed in both `.platform/confighooks` and `.platform/hooks`.

#### Reverse Proxy configuration

All AL2 based platforms now are similar in the way their [reverse proxy is configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html#platforms-linux-extend.proxy), using `nginx`.
In order to customise the reverse proxy with our own `nginx` configuration we can use the `.platform/nginx` directory.
Any `.conf` configuration file inside the directory `.platform/nginx/conf.d/` of the uploaded application source bundle will be included automatically by `nginx` during service startup.

[See `nginx` examples](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/) for what configuration is available. See also how we use this in the [Multiple Procfile processes](#multiple-procfile-processes) section below.

## Advanced configuration files (.ebextensions)

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ebextensions.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-ec2.html

I am not going to dive deep into this one because **it supports a massive amount of configuration**, and should be the last option only if nothing else works.
Configuration files are useful when all the above features we discussed (`Buildfile`, `Procfile`, `.platform/{confighooks/hooks}`) do not support what we want. In this case they can be handy since they support almost anything.

Important facts:
- A configuration file needs to be placed inside the `.ebextensions` directory at the root of the uploaded `.zip` file bundle, and should have the `.config` file extension.
- The configuration file structure is [documented here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-ec2.html) and supports anything from installing `yum` packages, to putting files on the filesystem, to adding/overriding CloudFormation resources.
- Read the above documentation pages in order to properly understand how `.ebextensions` work to avoid a lot of unnecessary wall-hitting ðŸ¤•

## Instance deployment workflow

The documentation section I visit most often is the [instance deployment workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html#platforms-linux-extend.workflow) diagram.

Unfortunately, it's not 100% complete since it's not showing in detail how shutdown and termination of the current app is happening, but it covers everything else.

Credits for the following image belong to AWS but I am putting it here for completeness as well:

## Example application

In this application we have a simple HTTP API written in Go. We don't use any of the advanced configuration features of Elastic Beanstalk here just to show that things can be easy and simple.

- Full code available: https://github.com/lambrospetrou/aws-playground/tree/master/elastic-beanstalk-al2-go/single-process

I didn't put a `Buildfile` in this application, so when we want to deploy we need to run `make` either locally or on our CI system, and then upload the bundle file located in `build/bundle.zip`.

This is how the directory structure looks like after running `make`:
```sh
âžœ  single-process git:(master) âœ— ls ./**
./Makefile

./app:
go.mod  main.go

./build:
Procfile   bin        bundle.zip

./build-tools:
Procfile
```

**Procfile**

```
web: ./bin/app -name web
```

**Application code (app.go)**

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"html"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	name := flag.String("name", "app", "The name of the service running, e.g. web2")
	port := flag.String("port", os.Getenv("PORT"), "The port for the server to listen.")
	flag.Parse()
	if strings.TrimSpace(*port) == "" {
		*port = "5000"
	}

	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		msg := fmt.Sprintf("Service %s Path, %q", *name, html.EscapeString(r.URL.Path))
		log.Println(msg)
		fmt.Fprintf(w, msg)
	})
	log.Printf("App %s starts listening at :%s\n", *name, *port)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+*port, nil))
}
```

Notice how we read the `PORT` environment variable but also support command line arguments and then start our HTTP listener on the given port.

After deploying the above on Elastic Beanstalk and enabling [CloudWatch Logs streaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo.cloudwatchlogs.html) we can see that automatically we get the following Log groups created and populated:

![single instance CloudWatch Logs](/articles-data/2022-01-30-elastic-beanstalk-al2-go/cwl-single-process.png)

Opening the `/aws/elasticbeanstalk/Al2go-env-1/var/log/web.stdout.log` log group contains the log lines from our application. The `web` prefix of the file corresponds to the `web` process name inside our `Procfile`.

The `/aws/elasticbeanstalk/Al2go-env-1/var/log/eb-engine.log` log group is contains all logs from everything that happens during a deployment, which is useful while troubleshooting failed deployments.

## Multiple Procfile processes

In this application we have the same application as above but we want to start it twice listening on different ports in order to show how we can override `nginx` to proxy two applications on the same host.
