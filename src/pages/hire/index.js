        <h3>Why you should trust me... And hire me!</h3>

        <p>
          I have been creating websites for more than 10 years, even before being paid for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have built dynamic single page applications with highly interactive visualizations using React, rendering flamegraphs with thousands of elements, for Amazon CodeGuru Profiler.
          I led the development of the Amazon LOVEFiLM mobile app using the hybrid cross-platform Ionic framework and AngularJS.
        </p>
        <p>I extensively used Java & Kotlin (Spring, Http4k) to server-render websites and their corresponding REST APIs for the Amazon retail website.</p>
        <p>I have deep knowledge of the web platform, and I can help you build the website and API your product deserves.</p>

        <p>
          I used Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a customer for years. But, I also experienced it from the inside. I was part of the team that built and released Amazon CodeGuru Profiler as a public AWS service in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the lead engineer for our service architecture ontop of AWS, and implemented core components of our Infrastructure-as-Code automation to achieve fully continuous deployments.
          Our final pipeline included gradual rollouts in waves of multiple regions, multiple staging and production environments, and all the bells and whistles regarding testing, canaries in production, automatic rollbacks, and more.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          During my time in the WhatsApp Dev Infra team, I contributed to the continuous integration system for WhatsApp Server.
          Most notably, we built FAUSTA, a fully automated system able to detect reliability, privacy, and performance regressions of a code change (pull-request).
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I always gravitated towards working with software release infrastructure.
          I also love the web platform, creating websites and APIs, and scaling them to millions of users.
        </p>
        <p><strong>I want to help you deliver value to your own customers safely, reliably, continuously.</strong></p>
