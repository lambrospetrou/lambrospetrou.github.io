          <p>Back in 2023, I wrote a very detailed article titled <a href="/articles/big-tech-software-interviews/?ref=lpcom-tech-interviews-page" title="Article How to pass the interview for software engineering roles in Big Tech">"How to pass the interview for software engineering roles in Big Tech"</a> for what to expect during your interview, how to prepare, and how to tackle the interviews themselves.</p>
          <p>I received a lot of positive feedback for this article, from friends, colleagues, and strangers that stumbled upon my article when searching for relevant terms.</p>
          <p>The most gratifying moments were when HR folks reached out from numerous teams asking if they could share my article as part of their own candidates preparation material. This still feels awesome whenever it happens üí™üèºü•≥</p>

            Why you can trust me.
          </h3>

          <p>
            I have been an interviewee for more than a decade, an interviewer for over a hundred interviews for software engineering positions, and I grew myself from junior Software Development Engineer to Principal Engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            After passing and failing many interviews, and conducting interviews for the <strong>coding</strong> and <strong>system design</strong> competencies, I now know where to focus during preparation, what's important during the interview itself, and also how to effectively communicate with the companies after the interview completes.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have worked at Amazon/AWS, Meta & WhatsApp, Datadog, and Cloudflare.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having worked at several Big Tech companies I know exactly what the <em>"checklist"</em> is, what your interviewers will be looking for, and what you should focus on.
          </p>

          <p><strong>‚òÖ Let me help you prepare, pass the interview, and negotiate a great offer. ‚òÖ</strong></p>
