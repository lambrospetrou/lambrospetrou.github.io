I delivered a talk doing an overview of the [Cloudflare Developer Platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/products/) in my home-city, Nicosia, Cyprus 🇨🇾.

Thanks to [Parsectix](https://www.parsectix.com/), specifically Pavlos, for organising the event ([LinkedIn Event](https://www.linkedin.com/events/devconnectseries-27276910731701153793)), and to all the folks that joined.

It was awesome to see some familiar faces in the audience.😅

The talk covers an overview of the Cloudflare Developer platform, core services, and how to gradually integrate it with your existing infrastructure as you see fit.

Some folks asked about Cloudflare's free tier, and how cheap the plans are compared to other platforms, raising concerns around rug-pulling in the future (not uncommon with other platforms).

Cloudflare already blogged about why and how we manage to offer the free tier, and how zero egress fee is possible, at the post [Reaffirming our commitment to free](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-commitment-to-free/).

I sent this already to some, and putting it here for future readers of this page with similar concerns.
