I delivered a talk doing an overview of the [Cloudflare Developer Platform](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/products/) in my home-city, Nicosia, Cyprus 🇨🇾.

Thanks to [Parsectix](https://www.parsectix.com/), specifically Pavlos, for organising the event ([LinkedIn Event](https://www.linkedin.com/events/devconnectseries-27276910731701153793)), and to all the folks that joined.

It was awesome to see some familiar faces in the audience.😅

The talk covers an overview of the Cloudflare Developer platform, core services, and how to gradually integrate it with your existing infrastructure as you see fit.
