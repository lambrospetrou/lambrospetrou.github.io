This article contains my favourite highlights from the [**Hell Yeah or No**](https://sive.rs/n) book from Derek Sivers.

I was tweeting these highlights while reading the book, but I wanted to persist them on my blog as well. Check the original Twitter thread at [@lambrospetrou/status/1585311232940445701](https://twitter.com/LambrosPetrou/status/1585311232940445701).

I strongly recommend reading the whole book. It's very short, with each chapter just being a couple of paragraphs, but immensely satisfying.

## 4. Actions, not words, reveal our real values

> No matter what you tell the world or tell yourself, your actions reveal your real values. **Your actions show you what you actually want.**

## 6. Why are you doing?

> It’s crucial to know why you’re doing what you’re doing. Most people don’t know. They just go with the flow.
>
> **Whatever you decide, you need to optimize for that goal, and be willing to let go of the others.**

## 8. Imitate. We are imperfect mirrors.

> **Like a funhouse mirror that distorts what it reflects, your imitation will turn out much different from the original.** Maybe even better.
>
> So look around at those existing ideas in the world.

## 11. Character predicts your future

> **How you do anything is how you do everything. It all matters.**
>
> Your actions are completely under your control, and seem to be the best indicator of future success.

## 14. Small actions change your self-identity

> **Your actions show the world who you are.** You won’t act differently until you think of yourself differently. So start by taking one small action that will change your self-identity.

## 15. If you’re not feeling “hell yeah!” then say no

> **Say no to almost everything.** This starts to free your time and mind.
>
> Then, when you find something you’re actually excited about, you’ll have the space in your life to give it your full attention. You’ll be able to take massive action, in a way that most people can’t, because you cleared away your clutter in advance. **Saying no makes your yes more powerful.**
>
> Refuse almost everything. Do almost nothing. But the things you do, do them all the way.

_This is really one the top highlights!_

## 19. Tilting my mirror (motivation is delicate)

> When you notice your motivation fading, you have to seek out the subtle cause. **A simple tweak can make all the difference between achieving something or not.**

## 24. There’s no speed limit

> [...] **“the standard pace is for chumps”** — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you’re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects.

## 34. Switch strategies

> **Early in your career, the best strategy is to say yes to everything.** The more things you try, and the more people you meet, the better. Each one might lead to your lucky break.
>
> Then when something is extra-rewarding, it’s time to switch strategies. **Focus all of your energy on this one thing.** Don’t be leisurely. Strike while it’s hot. Be a freak. **Give it everything you’ve got.**

## 35. Don’t be a donkey

> **The solution is to think long term.** Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years, then another.
>
> **Most people overestimate what they can do in one year, and underestimate what they can do in ten years.**
>
> Think long term. Use the future. Don’t be short sighted. Don’t be a donkey.

### 50. Don’t start a business until people are asking you to

> Most have an idea but no customers. For them I always say, “Don’t start a business until people are asking you to.”
>
> Don’t announce anything. Don’t choose a name. Don’t make a website or an app. Don’t build a system. **You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.**
>
> Then you get your first paying customer. Provide a one-on-one personal service. Then you get another paying customer. **Prove a real demand.**
>
> Then, as late as possible, you officially start your business.

## 66. If you think you haven’t found your passion…

> **It’s dangerous to think in terms of “passion” and “purpose” because they sound like such huge overwhelming things.**
>
> [...] **just notice what excites you and what scares you on a small moment-to-moment level.**
>
> If you keep thinking about doing something big, and you find that the idea both terrifies and intrigues you, it’s probably a worthy endeavor for you.
>
> You grow by doing what excites you and what scares you.

- <https://sive.rs/passion>

## 67. Whatever scares you, go do it

> Fear is just a form of excitement, and you know you should do what excites you.
>
> Best of all, **once you do something that scared you, you’re not scared of it anymore!** As you go through life, doing everything that scares you, you fear less and less in the world.
>
> Life is an ongoing process of choosing between safety (out of fear and need for defense) and risk (for the sake of progress and growth). Make the growth choice a dozen times a day.
