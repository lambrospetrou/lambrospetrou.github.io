title: AWS Elastic Beanstalk Go platform (AL2) â€” Deep Dive
description: "A deep dive into the Elastic Beanstalk Go platform (Amazon Linux 2), including single and multiple processes, and logging."
---

Even though my default and preferred way of deploying applications is [#serverless platforms](/articles/serverless-platforms-2022/), sometimes I need an actual long-running host. For example, some of the applications I run (e.g. [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)) are written in [Go](https://go.dev/) and use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as their database so in that case serverless does not work.

In this article I will explore the [Elastic Beanstalk Go platform based on Amazon Linux 2 (AL2)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-environment.html) for deploying a simple application. As a comparison, a couple of years ago I [wrote about the older Go platform](/articles/multiple-services-elastic-beanstalk/) based on Amazon Linux 1.

Even though I focus on the Go platform, **almost everything applies to [all Amazon Linux 2 based platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux.html#platforms-linux.list) (e.g. [Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/java-se-platform.html))**. You can also use the Go platform to deploy any application that is compiled to a binary that can run on Amazon Linux 2 (e.g. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)).

## Why use AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

> Easy to begin, Impossible to outgrow.

[Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) service offering by AWS.
It takes care of managing the platform updates, patching the underlying hosts, and abstracting away the AWS resources used while at the same time providing the necessary hooks and capabilities to customise and extend them when needed.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is similar in "principle" to [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/app-service/), or [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

I personally like Elastic Beanstalk and is my first choice of deploying to actual hosts/VM instances. I usually use the [single instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features-managing-env-types.html#single-instance-environ) environment to get the benefits without the costs, but there is also the [load-balanced environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features-managing-env-types.html#autoscale-environ) which allows you to scale as much as you want.

Features the Go platform provides which I cannot find in another platform as of time of writing ([see related tweet](https://twitter.com/LambrosPetrou/status/1487493396566528007)):
- single server instance only (because not everything is web-scale)
- persistent disk volumes (i.e. [Amazon EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/))
- deployments in-place on same instance with only 1-2s of downtime
  + restriction due to the persistent disk volume only being accessible from one host at a time
- managed platform: OS updates, host patching, language runtime updates
- variety of instance types, from the low-cost [T3](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t3/), to the powerful ARM-based Graviton2 [C6g](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/c6g/)

## Overview

The Amazon Linux 2 based platforms were added back in [2020](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-a-new-generation-of-aws-elastic-beanstalk-platforms/), and with that upgrade all the platforms now follow (almost) the same conventions and setup ([see supported Linux platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux.html#platforms-linux.versions)), which is a nice improvement over the previous platforms based on Amazon Linux 1 where each language had its own idiosyncracies.

The AWS documentation contains most of the things we need to know about the platforms but unfortunately as usual it's like they intentionally try to make it hard on their users, and they spread the information across multiple pages. In this article I will try to cover the main features of the platform and link to the corresponding documentation pages to make it easier to find what we need. This is basically a reference for future me ðŸ˜… 

All AL2 platforms offer the following features ([see documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html)):
- **Buildfile**: one-off commands to run from inside the uploaded bundle, e.g. building the source code to create the binary to run.
- **Procfile**: long-running monitored commands to run, e.g. the web server.
- **Platform hooks**: one-off commands to run during the deployment lifecycle hooks (e.g. predeploy, postdeploy). New to AL2 based platforms.
- **Reverse proxy configuration**: `nginx` is used as the reverse proxy for most platforms and there is a way to override its configuration. Some platforms also provide Apache HTTPD as proxy (e.g. Tomcat, Node.js, PHP, and Python).
- **Configuration files (.ebextensions)**: configuration to extend the Beanstalk environment. For example, add new CloudFormation resources (e.g. DynamoDB tables, EBS volumes), customise existing CloudFormation resources (e.g. the EC2 instance), override files on the filesystem, and many more.

Let's go into details for each one of these for the [Go platform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-environment.html) specifically.

## Buildfile

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-buildfile.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html

The `Buildfile` file should be placed at the root of the uploaded bundle `.zip` file and contains one-off commands that we want to run as part of the **build** phase of the deployment. The working directory of each command is the root of the uploaded bundle. If your uploaded bundle contains your source code then this is where you would put your application compile command. If you have a [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/) system to build your source code before-hand then you don't need a `Buildfile`.

For example, the following `Buildfile` will compile the Go application and create a binary file named `app` into the `bin/` directory:
```
cmd1: go build -o bin/app
```

The `cmd1:` part is nothing but just a name and does not have any meaning other than differentiating the commands to run. The following is also valid:
```
build: go build -o bin/app
check: ./validate-app-binary.sh
```

**Personal opinion:** I never use the `Buildfile` to build my application and I always have a CI system to build the source code (or even build it locally). This means that my uploaded bundle `.zip` file only contains the compiled artifacts, e.g. the `bin/app` binary from the above example. This makes deployments a bit faster as well since the build phase will not happen during the Beanstalk lifecycle and I don't worry about my build process being constrained by the machine running the actual application. For example, if you have a lot of dependencies or your tests need a lot of resources then doing it before triggering a Beanstalk deployment will allow you to use smaller lightweight instances for the actual application in production (e.g. `T3.nano`, `T4G.nano`).

## Procfile

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-procfile.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html

The Go platform also supports conventions to [automatically build and run your application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/go-environment.html), but I personally avoid them since they are less flexible than using `Procfile` and there is zero benefit in using them.

The `Procfile` file should be placed at the root of the uploaded bundle `.zip` file and contains the long-running commands that we want to run as part of the application. Each process started by these commands will be monitored by the environment and automatically restarted when they crash. This is the place where we specify the main command(s) to start the application.

For example, the following starts the `bin/app` and `bin/bgapp` apps with the right flags:
```
web: ./bin/app -name webapp
bgapp: ./bin/bgapp -name bgapp -port 5001
```

By default, Elastic Beanstalk listens to requests from the internet on HTTP port `80` and forwards them to port `5000` inside the host (configurable if needed). Therefore, the application should listen on port `5000`. Elastic Beanstalk looks for the command named `web` from `Procfile`, and sets the `PORT=5000` environment variable when running it. The application code will need to read that env variable when setting up its HTTP listener. We could also ignore the `PORT` env variable and hardcode port `5000` but it makes it harder to start your application on different ports (e.g. locally), so do the nice thing and read the env variable on startup ([see example application code below](#example-application)).

**NOTE1:** The default port can be changed from `5000` to something else by using `.ebextensions` and setting the `aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment.PORT` property. Read more about this in the [reverse proxy configuration docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html#platforms-linux-extend.proxy) (make sure to expand the "Reverse proxy configuration" section).

**NOTE2:** In the previous version of the platform (AL1) all processes in the `Procfile` were getting the `PORT` set to a value starting from `5000` and then growing in increments of `+100`. This **does not apply anymore in AL2 platforms** and **only** the explicitly named `web` process has the `PORT` env set, which is why I explicitly set the port for `bgapp` in the above example.

**NOTE3:** There are some nuances around logging and how the logs are streamed to CloudWatch Logs when `Procfile` contains more than the `web` process but we will [explore those later](#logging).

## Platform hooks

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html

Platform hooks are a new addition to the AL2 based platforms. The only way to extend and customise Elastic Beanstalk before was using the `.ebextensions` configuration files but that was/is complicated and very error-prone (lots of trial-and-error needed ðŸ˜“). Platform hooks cover 90% of all use-cases (personal guesstimate), and they make our lives much easier.

The [Platform hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html#platforms-linux-extend.hooks) (expand section) are basically script files placed inside the `.platform/hooks` directory, under one of the following sub-directories: `prebuild`, `predeploy`, `postdeploy`, depending when they need to run.

The scripts inside each of those directories are run in order of their filename. For example, let's examine the following directory structure:
```sh
$ ls .platform/hooks/**
.platform/hooks/postdeploy:
01-validate-http.sh  02-update-route53.sh

.platform/hooks/predeploy:
01-setup-ebs.sh
```

With the above files the script `01-setup-ebs.sh` will be executed before the new version of the app is activated (`predeploy`), and the `01-validate-http.sh` and `02-update-route53.sh` scripts will run after the switch (`postdeploy`) in this specific order.

### Config hooks

Apart from the `.platform/hooks` directory, there is also a `.platform/confighooks` directory supported. At first glance, the difference between the two is confusing. Even though the available hooks and execution rules are the same, the type of changes in a deployment will decide which hooks to trigger. 

> A configuration deployment occurs when you make configuration changes that only update environment instances without recreating them.

According to the [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html#:~:text=A%20configuration%20deployment%20occurs%20when%20you%20make%20configuration%20changes%20that%20only%20update%20environment%20instances%20without%20recreating%20them.%20The%20following%20option%20updates%20cause%20a%20configuration%20update.) the following changes trigger `.platform/confighooks` only:
- Environment properties and platform-specific settings
- Static files
- AWS X-Ray daemon
- Log storage and streaming
- Application port

**NOTE:** In order to make sure a script runs regardless of the type of changes it has to be placed in both `.platform/confighooks` and `.platform/hooks`.

### Reverse Proxy configuration

All AL2 based platforms now are similar in the way their [reverse proxy is configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html#platforms-linux-extend.proxy), using `nginx`.
In order to customise the reverse proxy with our own `nginx` configuration we can use the `.platform/nginx` directory.
Any `.conf` configuration file inside the directory `.platform/nginx/conf.d/` of the uploaded application source bundle will be included automatically by `nginx` during service startup.

I rarely have to modify the proxy configuration, and when I do it's to adapt some of the default limits, e.g. concurrency connections, timeouts.
See [`nginx` examples](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/full/) for what configuration is available, and the [Multiple Procfile processes](#multiple-procfile-processes) section below for how this can be used to proxy two servers running on the same host.

## Advanced configuration files (.ebextensions)

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ebextensions.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-ec2.html

I am not going to dive deep into this one because **it supports a massive amount of configuration**, and should be the last option only if nothing else works.
Configuration files are useful when all the above features we discussed (`Buildfile`, `Procfile`, `.platform/{confighooks/hooks}`) do not support what we want. In this case they can be handy since they support almost anything.

- A configuration file needs to be placed inside the `.ebextensions` directory at the root of the uploaded `.zip` file bundle, and should have the `.config` file extension.
- The configuration file structure is [documented here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-ec2.html) and supports anything from installing `yum` packages, to putting files on the filesystem, to adding/overriding CloudFormation resources.
- Read the above documentation pages in order to properly understand how `.ebextensions` work to avoid a lot of unnecessary head wall-hitting ðŸ¤•

Example of a configuration file (`.ebextensions/awslogs.config`) that configures the CloudWatch Logs agent to stream the `/var/log/bgapp.stdout.log` log file to CloudWatch Logs: https://gist.github.com/lambrospetrou/758a312a1317532eb6bb0960985df83e

## Instance deployment workflow

The documentation section I visit most often is the [instance deployment workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/platforms-linux-extend.html#platforms-linux-extend.workflow) diagram.

Unfortunately, it's not 100% complete since it's not showing in detail how shutdown and termination of the current app is happening, but it covers everything else.

Credits for the following image belong to AWS but I am putting it here for completeness as well:

![AL2 platform instance deployment lifecycle](/articles-data/2022-01-30-elastic-beanstalk-al2-go/platforms-linux-extend-order.png)

## Example application

In this application we have a simple HTTP API written in Go. We don't use any of the advanced configuration features of Elastic Beanstalk here just to show that things can be easy and simple.

- Full code available: https://github.com/lambrospetrou/aws-playground/tree/master/elastic-beanstalk-al2-go/single-process

I didn't put a `Buildfile` in this application, so when we want to deploy we need to run `make` either locally or on our CI system, and then upload the bundle file located in `build/bundle.zip`.

This is how the directory structure looks like after running `make`:
```sh
âžœ  single-process git:(master) âœ— ls ./**
./Makefile

./app:
go.mod  main.go

./build:
Procfile   bin        bundle.zip

./build-tools:
Procfile
```

**Procfile**

```
web: ./bin/app -name web
```

**Application code (app.go)**

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"html"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	name := flag.String("name", "app", "The name of the service running, e.g. web2")
	port := flag.String("port", os.Getenv("PORT"), "The port for the server to listen.")
	flag.Parse()
	if strings.TrimSpace(*port) == "" {
		*port = "5000"
	}

	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		msg := fmt.Sprintf("Service %s Path, %q", *name, html.EscapeString(r.URL.Path))
		log.Println(msg)
		fmt.Fprintf(w, msg)
	})
	log.Printf("App %s starts listening at :%s\n", *name, *port)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":"+*port, nil))
}
```

Notice how we read the `PORT` environment variable but also support command line arguments and then start our HTTP listener on the given port.

After deploying the above on Elastic Beanstalk and enabling [CloudWatch Logs streaming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo.cloudwatchlogs.html) we can see that automatically we get the following Log groups created and populated:

![single instance CloudWatch Logs](/articles-data/2022-01-30-elastic-beanstalk-al2-go/cwl-single-process.png)

Opening the `/aws/elasticbeanstalk/Al2go-env-1/var/log/web.stdout.log` log group contains the log lines from our application. The `web` prefix of the file corresponds to the `web` process name inside our `Procfile`.

The `/aws/elasticbeanstalk/Al2go-env-1/var/log/eb-engine.log` log group contains all logs from the Beanstalk processes that run during a deployment, which is useful while troubleshooting failed deployments or trying to understand how deployments work.

Elastic Beanstalk provides an endpoint for our application which corresponds to the HTTP port `80` mentioned in [Procfile](#procfile) section above, and looks like `http://al2go-env-1.eba-f2qnm2t6.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/` where `al2go-env-1` is the name of my environment. Unfortunately this endpoint is not HTTPS...

## Multiple Procfile processes

In this section we have the same application as above, but this time I am starting it twice listening on different ports in order to show how we can override `nginx` to proxy two applications on the same host.

- Full code available: https://github.com/lambrospetrou/aws-playground/tree/master/elastic-beanstalk-al2-go/multi-process

This is how the directory structure looks like after running `make`:
```sh
âžœ  multi-process git:(master) ls ./** ./.**
./Makefile  ./README.md

./.ebextensions:
awslogs.config

./.platform:
nginx

./app:
go.mod  main.go

./build:
Procfile   bin        bundle.zip

./build-tools:
Procfile
```

**Procfile**

```
web: bin/app -name web
bgapp: bin/app -name bgapp -port 5001
```

**Application code (app.go)**

Exactly the same as before.

**What happens?**

We have a process named `web` which is the same as before starting the server at given `PORT` (`5000`), and also a second process named `bgapp` which starts the same server at port `5001` explicitly. As I mentioned in the [Procfile](#procfile) section only the server at port `5000` will actually receive requests by default, so we need to override the `nginx` configuration to route traffic accordingly.

We do this by providing `.platform/nginx/conf.d/01_proxy.conf`:
```
server {
	server_name .elasticbeanstalk.com;
	listen 80;

	location /web2 {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5001;
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	}

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
		proxy_set_header Host $host;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	}
}
```

When Beanstalk starts the `nginx` service it automatically includes all `.conf` files in `.platform/nginx/conf.d/` and therefore our configuration above will be used. What it does is basically route any request under the `/web2` path to our server named `bgapp`, and anything else goes to the main server named `web` (remember our `Procfile`).

### Logging

Unfortunately Elastic Beanstalk has some rough edges, and logging is one of those. When we only have a single `web` process everything is fine and as we saw above all the logs we need are automatically streamed to CloudWatch Logs (if enabled). The issue is when we have more than one process, e.g. in our current scenario where we also have the `bgapp` process.

After reading the following resources I realised I need to provide a custom configuration file to install AWS CloudWatch Logs agent and set it up to stream the additional `bgapp.stdout.log` file to CloudWatch Logs.
- https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elastic-beanstalk-customized-log-files/
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo.cloudwatchlogs.html#AWSHowTo.cloudwatchlogs.streaming.custom

You can find the `.ebextensions/awslogs.config` file I used at <https://github.com/lambrospetrou/aws-playground/blob/master/elastic-beanstalk-al2-go/multi-process/.ebextensions/awslogs.config>.

**NOTE:** I [opened a roadmap feature request](https://github.com/aws/elastic-beanstalk-roadmap/issues/225) to the Beanstalk team to make this automatically for all processes inside the `Procfile` since it doesn't make any sense to me to have to do this on my own since it's already done for the `web` process.

## Conclusion

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is simple, and flexible enough to do anything I want. When AWS Lambda cannot be used, this is my goto platform.

In this article I put everything I had in my notes from using Elastic Beanstalk in my own projects over the years.
There are some rough edges but the main issue I encounter is that the documentation is spread all over the place. Having this information structured makes it a bit easier to use and troubleshoot things.

In the worst case, even if nobody else needs this, future me will be very happy I took the time to write this down ðŸ˜Ž
