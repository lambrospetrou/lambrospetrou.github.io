Open <https://checkip.amazonaws.com/>.

Use the following to get it programmatically:
```sh
curl https://checkip.amazonaws.com
```

You can even use my Webscripts platform by [running this Hurl Webscript](https://webscripts.lambrospetrou.com/#openEditorSrcText=R0VUIGh0dHBzOi8vY2hlY2tpcC5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tCgpIVFRQIDIwMApbQXNzZXJ0c10KYm9keSBjb250YWlucyAic2hvdy10aGUtcmVhbC1JUC1pbi10aGUtcmVzdWx0cy10YWIiCg==), and you will see the IP address in the results tab.
