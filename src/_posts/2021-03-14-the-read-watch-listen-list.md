title: The Read-Watch-Listen list
description: "A new page with a lot of content I find interesting online, including articles, videos, and audio/podcasts."

I often share links to content I read, watch, or listen in my social media accounts (mostly [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LambrosPetrou)).
However, many times I am trying to find a link I know I shared before, but don't remember exactly where it was hosted or who created it. And then I end up searching or scrolling my tweets in an attempt to find it. Looking for a needle in a haystack...

I decided to create a page where I will keep a list of content that I find interesting, and is worthy of sharing with others. This will be a curated list of things, and not just a dump of my tweets, with just what I consider great.

I spent a few hours scrolling through my tweets for the past three years and I extracted the content that I still find interesting, and it's not behind a paywall at the moment. You can find the new page at [https://www.lambrospetrou.com/read-watch-listen](/read-watch-listen), and at the corresponding navigation link at the top of all pages on this website. The list is ordered with the content I most recently read at the top, therefore new items will always go at the top.

I also created a [dedicated RSS feed](/feed/read-watch-listen.rss.xml) separate from my [articles RSS feed](/feed/rss.xml) in order to provide an easy way for people to consume this list using their favourite feed reader.

I hope more people find the content of this list interesting. Feel free to get in touch if you have any feedback, or want to share great content with me.

And just for the history records, a screenshot of the list at the article's time of writing üëáüèº
