Minibri Temp now supports files formatted in [Asciidoc](https://asciidoc.org/).
The uploaded file needs to have `.adoc` or `.asciidoc` extension to go through Asciidoc conversion.

You can find an example of a rendered document at <https://temp.minibri.com/view/asciidoc-guide>.

The source Asciidoc file of 6000+ lines which generated the above output can be found at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/lambrospetrou/36af630d6a3c0393f1bcd964f72e2ebd).
