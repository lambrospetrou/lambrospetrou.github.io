    	<p>I have been a user of Wordpress since 2006 in order to provide my own blog, latest version found at <a href="http://mastergenius.net">MasterGenius.NET</a>. I invested a lot of time in it learning PHP, web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript and the likes) and I thank it since it made my way into the web as a developer. There have been many times I wanted to switch out from it and make my own micro-blog service but due to time constraints and other things popping up I always halted the process.</p>

<p>Recently, I started using Go language as my primary tool for my latest projects and I am really amazed by how much you can create in a small amount of time and at the same time having a substantial performance. All other languages that tried to do something similar failed either in performance or in coding-style, at least for my taste. <strong>Go is the sweet spot</strong> ;)</p>

<p>I wanted a project in order to learn Go further than reading and doing some tutorials so the micro-blog service project kicked-off. This blog is the result of those 3-4 days and I am going to use it as a more personal blog with thoughts and opinions on variety of topics and also post some useful tutorials (without going too much out-of-topic though like my previous blog).</p>

<p>This blog is written entirely in pure <strong>Go</strong> <a href="http://golang.org">#golang</a> language without any 3rd party library (i.e gorilla/mux or martini) that many Go articles suggested and I have to admit that I am very impressed. The core standard library is very sufficient and provides you all the tools to create anything you want easily. As a back-end I am using <strong>Couchbase server 2.x</strong> which is one of the best NoSQL databases I have tried so far, and speedy-demon too. As for the content of the articles I made a very minimalistic and simple panel where I can write them in <strong>Markdown</strong> format. I have chosen Markdown for the articles because it lets me write in plain text without any HTML tags or CSS classes getting involved, thus I can concentrate on the content. And it is good to know since it is being used in many other services too, like <em>Github</em>. The Markdown content is compiled in HTML when posted by the Go back-end.</p>

<p>The old blog is still live, at least for now, and I will try to find some noteworthy tutorials I wrote back in the days and post them here too, like I already did with some of them but I will keep this blog cleaner and more personal.</p>

<p>I hope you like this new blog and if you have any suggestions donâ€™t hesitate to contact me ;)</p>
